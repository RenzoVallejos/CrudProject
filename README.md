# CrudProject
This is a CRUD API project which allows the user to insert, delete, and update information. To interact with the app, the user needs to create a postman to collect and request
data from the localhost. From there, one can modify the number of items, price, type to collect a shopping list of items. What I learned from this project is how 
back-end developer works by looking at how browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.
